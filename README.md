# Style-Swiper

# We live in a world where fashion trends evolve rapidly, with people often struggling to find clothing that matches their style without spending hours browsing through many online stores. The process can be overwhelming and inefficient. By creating an app that allows users to swipe on clothing items, similar to dating apps, they can quickly express their preferences in an engaging and intuitive way.
This project aims to simplify the shopping experience by curating a personalized collection of liked clothing pieces and providing users with direct recommendations on where to purchase these items. Additionally, offering essential information such as pricing, availability, and brand details ensures a seamless and informed decision-making process. This app has the potential to revolutionize the way people discover and shop for fashion, combining convenience, personalization, and fun into one platform.
